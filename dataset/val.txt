sometimes you want to say, “i love you, but…”yet the “but” takes away the ‘i love you’. in love their are no ‘buts’ or ‘if’s’ or ‘when’. it’s just there, and always. no beginning, no end. it’s the condition-less state of the heart. not a feeling that comes and goes at the whim of the emotions. it is there in our heart, a part of our heart…eventually grafting itself into each limb and cell of our bodies. love changes our brain, the way we move and talk. love lives in our spirit and graces us with its presence each day, until death.to say “i love you, but….” is to say, “i did not love you at all”.i say this to you now: i love you, with no beginning, no end. i love you as you have become an extra necessary organ in my body. i love you as only a girl could love a boy. without fear. without expectations. wanting nothing in return, except that you allow me to keep you here in my heart, that i may always know your strength, your eyes, and your spirit that gave me freedom and let me fly. | breakup, breakups, friendship, i-love-him, i-love-you, jamie-weise, love, love-affair, love-and-romance, love-story, lovers, passion, passions, unconditional

when i talk about unrequited love, most of you probably think about romantic love, but there are many other kinds of love that are not adequately returned, if they are returned at all. an angry adolescent may not love her mother back as her mother loves her; an abusive father doesn't return the innocent open love of his young child. but grief is the ultimate unrequieted love. however hard and however long we love someone who has died, they can never love us back. at least that is how it feels... | loss, love, unrequited-love

you were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.you shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of god.but let there be spaces in your togetherness,and let the winds of the heavens dance between you.love one another, but make not a bond of love:let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loafsing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.for only the hand of life can contain your hearts.and stand together yet not too near together:for the pillars of the temple stand apart,and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow. | love, marriage

one of the few downsides to being awakened is that we no longer require sleep; therefore we also no longer dream. it's a shame, because if i could dream, i know i'd dream about you.i'd dream about the way you smell and how your dark hair feels like silk between my fingers. i'd dream about the smoothness of your skin and the fierceness of your lips when we kiss. without dreams, i have to be content with my own imagination– which is almost as good. i can picture all of those things perfectly, as well as how it'll be when i take your life from this world. | commitment, death, dimitri-belikov, love

what was love, really? flowers, chocolate, and poetry? or was it something else? was it being able to finish someone's jokes? was it having absolute faith that someone was there at your back? was it knowing someone so well that they instantly understood why you did the things you did—and shared those same beliefs? | faith, love

there is lust and then there is love. they are related, but still very different things. to indulge in one requires little but honeyed speech and a change of clothes; to obtain the other, by contrast, a man must give up his rib. in return, his woman will undo the sin of eve, and bring him back into paradise. | love, lust

and when love came to us twice and lied to us twice we decided to never love again that was fair fair to us and fair to love itself. we ask for no mercy or no miracles; we are strong enough to live and to die and to kill flies, attend the boxing matches, go to the racetrack, live on luck and skill, get alone, get alone often, and if you can't sleep alone be careful of the words you speak in your sleep; and ask for no mercy no miracles; and don't forget: time is meant to be wasted, love failsand death is useless. | love

once upon a time, there was a boy. he lived in a village that no longer exists, in a house that no longer exists, on the edge of a field that no longer exists, where everything was discovered, and everything was possible. a stick could be a sword, a pebble could be a diamond, a tree, a castle. once upon a time, there was a boy who lived in a house across the field, from a girl who no longer exists. they made up a thousand games. she was queen and he was king. in the autumn light her hair shone like a crown. they collected the world in small handfuls, and when the sky grew dark, and they parted with leaves in their hair.once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering. | childhood, love

think of two people, living together day after day, year after year, in this small space, standing elbow to elbow cooking at the same small stove, squeezing past each other on the narrow stairs, shaving in front of the same small bathroom mirror, constantly jogging, jostling, bumping against each other’s bodies by mistake or on purpose, sensually, aggressively, awkwardly, impatiently, in rage or in love – think what deep though invisible tracks they must leave, everywhere, behind them! | love, memories

"one thing i do know about intimacy is that there are certain natural laws which govern the sexual experience of two people, and that these laws cannot be budged any more than gravity can be negotiated with. to feel physically comfortable with someone else's body is not a decision you can make. it has very little to do with how two people think or act or talk or even look. the mysterious magnet is either there, buried somewhere deep behind the sternum, or it is not. when it isn't there (as i have learned in the past, with heartbreaking clarity) you can no more force it to exist than a surgeon can force a patient's body to accept a kidney from the wrong donor. my friend annie says it all comes down to one simple question: ""do you want your belly pressed against this person's belly forever --or not? | love"

to love at all is to be vulnerable. love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. if you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. but in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. it will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. to love is to be vulnerable. | love

out of my thoughts! you are part of my existence, part of myself. you have been in every line i have ever read, since i first came here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. you have been in every prospect i have ever seen since – on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. you have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with. the stones of which the strongest london buildings are made, are not more real, or more impossible to displace with your hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and everywhere, and will be. estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil. but, in this separation i associate you only with the good, and i will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress i may. o god bless you, god forgive you! | love

people always fall in love with the most perfect aspects of each other’s personalities. who wouldn’t? anybody can love the most wonderful parts of another person. but that’s not the clever trick. the really clever trick is this: can you accept the flaws? can you look at your partner’s faults honestly and say, ‘i can work around that. i can make something out of it.’? because the good stuff is always going to be there, and it’s always going to pretty and sparkly, but the crap underneath can ruin you. | dating, love, marriage

it was the pure language of the world. it required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. what the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. he was more certain of it than of anything in the world. he had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed. but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. because, when you know that language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city. and when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. there is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. it is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning. | love

your problem is you don't understand what that word means. people think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. but a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that's holding you back, the person who brings you to your attention so you can change your life. a true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. but to live with a soul mate forever? nah. too painful. soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then they leave. | love, soul-mates

every time we make the decision to love someone, we open ourselves to great suffering, because those we most love cause us not only great joy but also great pain. the greatest pain comes from leaving. when the child leaves home, when the husband or wife leaves for a long period of time or for good, when the beloved friend departs to another country or dies … the pain of the leaving can tear us apart.still, if we want to avoid the suffering of leaving, we will never experience the joy of loving. and love is stronger than fear, life stronger than death, hope stronger than despair. we have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking. | leaving, love, pain
now very much against her will, she thought of the way jace had looked at her then, the blaze of faith in his eyes, his belief in her. he had always thought she was strong. he had showed it in everything he did, in every look and every touch. simon had faith in her too, yet when he'd held her, it had been as if she were something fragile, something made of delicate glass. but jace had held her with all the strength he had, never wondering if she could take it--he'd known she was as strong has he was. | clary-fray, faith, jace-wayland, love, strength

i had no illusions about you,' he said. 'i knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. but i loved you. i knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and commonplace. but i loved you. i knew that you were second-rate. but i loved you. it's comic when i think how hard i tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious i was to hide from you that i wasn't ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. i knew how frightened you were of intelligence and i did everything i could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew. i knew that you'd only married me for convenience. i loved you so much, i didn't care. most people, as far as i can see, when they're in love with someone and the love isn't returned feel that they have a grievance. they grow angry and bitter. i wasn't like that. i never expected you to love me, i didn't see any reason that you should. i never thought myself very lovable. i was thankful to be allowed to love you and i was enraptured when now and then i thought you were pleased with me or when i noticed in your eyes a gleam of good-humored affection. i tried not to bore you with my love; i knew i couldn't afford to do that and i was always on the lookout for the first sign that you were impatient with my affection. what most husbands expect as a right i was prepared to receive as a favor. | husbands, love, marriage
i feel good with my husband: i like his warmth and his bigness and his being-there and his making and his jokes and stories and what he reads and how he likes fishing and walks and pigs and foxes and little animals and is honest and not vain or fame-crazy and how he shows his gladness for what i cook him and joy for when i make him something, a poem or a cake, and how he is troubled when i am unhappy and wants to do anything so i can fight out my soul-battles and grow up with courage and a philosophical ease. i love his good smell and his body that fits with mine as if they were made in the same body-shop to do just that. what is only pieces, doled out here and there to this boy and that boy, that made me like pieces of them, is all jammed together in my husband. so i don't want to look around any more: i don't need to look around for anything. | love, marriage, romance

many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. what then kills love? only this: neglect. not to see you when you stand before me. not to think of you in the little things. not to make the road wide for you, the table spread for you. to choose you out of habit not desire, to pass the flower seller without a thought. to leave the dishes unwashed, the bed unmade, to ignore you in the mornings, make use of you at night. to crave another while pecking your cheek. to say your name without hearing it, to assume it is mine to call. | love

you're beautiful, but you're empty...one couldn't die for you. of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. but my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one i've watered. since she's the one i put under glass, since she's the one i sheltered behind the screen. since she's the one for whom i killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies). since she's the one i listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. since she's my rose. | caring, inspirational, love, roses, uniqueness

to him she seemed so beautiful, so seductive, so different from ordinary people, that he could not understand why no one was as disturbed as he by the clicking of her heels on the paving stones, why no one else's heart was wild with the breeze stirred by the sighs of her veils, why everyone did not go mad with the movements of her braid, the flight of her hands, the gold of her laughter. he had not missed a single one of her gestures, not one of the indications of her character, but he did not dare approach her for fear of destroying the spell. | beauty, love

jesus christ lived in the midst of his enemies. at the end all his disciples deserted him. on the cross he was utterly alone, surrounded by evildoers and mockers. for this cause he had come, to bring peace to the enemies of god. so the christian, too, belongs not in the seclusion of a cloistered life but in the thick of foes. there is his commission, his work.

there is an emotional promiscuity we’ve noticed among many good young men and women. the young man understands something of the journey of the heart. he wants to talk, to “share the journey.” the woman is grateful to be pursued, she opens up. they share the intimacies of their lives - their wounds, their walks with god. but he never commits. he enjoys her... then leaves. and she wonders, what did i do wrong? she failed to see his passivity. he really did not ever commit or offer assurances that he would. like willoughby to marianne in sense and sensibility.be careful you do not offer too much of yourself to a man until you have good, solid evidence that he is a strong man willing to commit. look at his track record with other women. is there anything to be concerned about there? if so, bring it up. also, does he have any close male friends - and what are they like as men? can he hold down a job? is he walking with god in a real and intimate way? is he facing the wounds of his own life, and is he also demonstrating a desire to repent of adam’s passivity and/or violence? is he headed somewhere with his life? a lot of questions, but your heart is a treasure, and we want you to offer it only to a man who is worthy and ready to handle it well. | character, emotions, heart, love, men, pursue, relationships, women

perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company. | love

when you find somebody you love, all the way through, and she loves you—even with your weaknesses, your flaws, everything starts to click into place. and if you can talk to her, and she listens, if she makes you laugh, and makes you think, makes you want, makes you see who you really are, and who you are is better, just better with her, you’d be crazy not to want to spend the rest of your life with her.

and it came to me then. that we were wonderful traveling companions but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits. from far off they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality they're nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere. when the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be together. maybe even open our hearts to each other. but that was only for the briefest moment. in the next instant we'd be in absolute solitude. until we burned up and became nothing. | aloneness, love

we’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. but if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. why is this? because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. but it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. and it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. you’re looking for the wrong person. but not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, “this is the problem i want to have.”i will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way. | being-loved, completion, inspirational, love, relationships

visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. it is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. the soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. when men embrace feminist thinking and preactice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. a genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving. | love, men, patriarchy, relationships, women

let me tell you about love, that silly word you believe is about whether you like somebody or whether somebody likes you or whether you can put up with somebody in order to get something or someplace you want or you believe it has to do with how your body responds to another body like robins or bison or maybe you believe love is how forces or nature or luck is benign to you in particular not maiming or killing you but if so doing it for your own good. love is none of that. there is nothing in nature like it. not in robins or bison or in the banging tails of your hunting dogs and not in blossoms or suckling foal. love is divine only and difficult always. if you think it is easy you are a fool. if you think it is natural you are blind. it is a learned application without reason or motive except that it is god. you do not deserve love regardless of the suffering you have endured. you do not deserve love because somebody did you wrong. you do not deserve love just because you want it. you can only earn - by practice and careful contemplations - the right to express it and you have to learn how to accept it. which is to say you have to earn god. you have to practice god. you have to think god-carefully. and if you are a good and diligent student you may secure the right to show love. love is not a gift. it is a diploma. a diploma conferring certain privileges: the privilege of expressing love and the privilege of receiving it. how do you know you have graduated? you don't. what you do know is that you are human and therefore educable, and therefore capable of learning how to learn, and therefore interesting to god, who is interested only in himself which is to say he is interested only in love. do you understand me? god is not interested in you. he is interested in love and the bliss it brings to those who understand and share the interest. couples that enter the sacrament of marriage and are not prepared to go the distance or are not willing to get right with the real love of god cannot thrive. they may cleave together like robins or gulls or anything else that mates for life. but if they eschew this mighty course, at the moment when all are judged for the disposition of their eternal lives, their cleaving won't mean a thing. god bless the pure and holy. amen. | god, love

nothing on this planet can compare with a woman’s love—it is kind and compassionate, patient and nurturing, generous and sweet and unconditional. pure. if you are her man, she will walk on water and through a mountain for you, too, no matter how you’ve acted out, no matter what crazy thing you’ve done, no matter the time or demand. if you are her man, she will talk to you until there just aren’t any more words left to say, encourage you when you’re at rock bottom and think there just isn’t any way out, hold you in her arms when you’re sick, and laugh with you when you’re up. and if you’re her man and that woman loves you—i mean really loves you?—she will shine you up when you’re dusty, encourage you when you’re down, defend you even when she’s not so sure you were right, and hang on your every word, even when you’re not saying anything worth listening to. and no matter what you do, no matter how many times her friends say you’re no good, no matter how many times you slam the door on the relationship, she will give you her very best and then some, and keep right on trying to win over your heart, even when you act like everything she’s done to convince you she’s the one just isn’t good enough.that’s a woman’s love—it stands the test of time, logic, and all circumstance....well, i’m here to tell you that expecting that kind of love— that perfection—from a man is unrealistic. that’s right, i said it—it’s not gonna happen, no way, no how. because a man’s love isn’t like a woman’s love. | love, men, women

"we can't..."" he told me.""i know,"" i agreed.then his mouth was on mine again, and this time, i knew there would be no turning back. there were no walls this time. our bodies wrapped together as he tried to get my coat off, then his shirt, then my shirt. ... it really was a lot like when we'd fought out on the quad earlier-that same passion and heat. i think at the end of the day, the instincts that power fighting and sex aren't so different. they all come from an animal side of us. yet, as more and more clothes came off, it went beyond just animal passion. it was sweet and wonderful at the same time. when i looked into his eyes, i could see without a doubt that he loved me more than anyone else in the world, that i was his salvation, the same way that he was mine. i'd never expected my first time to be in a cabin in the woods, but i realized the place didn't matter. the person did. with someone you loved, you could be anywhere, and it would be incredible. being in the most luxurious bed in the world wouldn't matter if you were with someone you didn't love. | love, vampire-academy"

"to love someone is like moving into a house,"" sonja used to say. ""at first you fall in love in everything new, you wonder every morning that this is one's own, as if they are afraid that someone will suddenly come tumbling through the door and say that there has been a serious mistake and that it simply was not meant to would live so fine. but as the years go by, the facade worn, the wood cracks here and there, and you start to love this house not so much for all the ways it is perfect in that for all the ways it is not. you become familiar with all its nooks and crannies. how to avoid that the key gets stuck in the lock if it is cold outside. which floorboards have some give when you step on them, and exactly how to open the doors for them not to creak. that's it, all the little secrets that make it your home.

and sometimes i believe your relentless analysis of june leaves something out, which is your feeling for her beyond knowledge, or in spite of knowledge. i often see how you sob over what you destroy, how you want to stop and just worship; and you do stop, and then a moment later you are at it again with a knife, like a surgeon.what will you do after you have revealed all there is to know about june? truth. what ferocity in your quest of it. you destroy and you suffer. in some strange way i am not with you, i am against you. we are destined to hold two truths. i love you and i fight you. and you, the same. we will be stronger for it, each of us, stronger with our love and our hate. when you caricature and nail down and tear apart, i hate you. i want to answer you, not with weak or stupid poetry but with a wonder as strong as your reality. i want to fight your surgical knife with all the occult and magical forces of the world. | hate, love, magic, science
it has made me better loving you... it has made me wiser, and easier, and brighter. i used to want a great many things before, and to be angry that i did not have them. theoretically, i was satisfied. i flattered myself that i had limited my wants. but i was subject to irritation; i used to have morbid sterile hateful fits of hunger, of desire. now i really am satisfied, because i can’t think of anything better. it’s just as when one has been trying to spell out a book in the twilight, and suddenly the lamp comes in. i had been putting out my eyes over the book of life, and finding nothing to reward me for my pains; but now that i can read it properly i see that it’s a delightful story. | desire, love, satisfaction

we looked at each other for a minute, not saying anything, but i could feel the air between us shift. it became thick, sultry, and tangible—like when the air changes right before a storm. i could feel its power envelop me as it brushed across my skin. even though i couldn’t see it, i knew a storm was coming. | love, romance

now there is one thing i can tell you: you will enjoy certain pleasures you would not fathom now. when you still had your mother you often thought of the days when you would have her no longer. now you will often think of days past when you had her. when you are used to this horrible thing that they will forever be cast into the past, then you will gently feel her revive, returning to take her place, her entire place, beside you. at the present time, this is not yet possible. let yourself be inert, wait till the incomprehensible power ... that has broken you restores you a little, i say a little, for henceforth you will always keep something broken about you. tell yourself this, too, for it is a kind of pleasure to know that you will never love less, that you will never be consoled, that you will constantly remember more and more. | death, grief, loss, love, mothers, mourning

he kissed me wildly, overwhelming me like a giant wave rushing to shore. i was soon lost in the turbulent grasp of his embrace and yet…i knew i was safe. his wild kiss drove me, pushed me, asked me questions i was unwilling to consider. but i was cherished by this dark poseidon, and though he had the power to crush me utterly, to drown me in the purple depths of his wake, he held me aloft, separate. his passionate kiss changed. it gentled and soothed and entreated. together we drifted towards a safe harbor. the god of the sea set me down securely on a sandy beach and steadied me as i trembled. effervescent tingles shot through my limbs delighting me with surges of sparkling sensation like sandy toes tickled by bubbly waves. finally, the waves moved away and i felt my poseidon watching me from a distance. we looked at each other knowing we were forever changed by the experience. we both knew that i would always belong to the sea and that i would never be able to part from it and be whole again. | love, romance
